# Microsoft Live Share Canvas

Easily add collaborative inking to your Teams meeting app, powered by [Fluid Framework](https://fluidframework.com/).

This package is an extension of Microsoft Live Share, and requires the `@microsoft/live-share` package. You can find it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/live-share).

You can find our documentation at [aka.ms/livesharecanvas](https://aka.ms/livesharecanvas).

## Installing

To add the latest version of the SDK to your application using NPM:

```bash
npm install fluid-framework @fluidframework/azure-client @microsoft/live-share @microsoft/live-share-canvas --save
```

or using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add fluid-framework @fluidframework/azure-client @microsoft/live-share @microsoft/live-share-canvas --save
```

## Building the packages

After cloning the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk), navigate to the root folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will use npm workspaces to hoist and build all dependencies.

## How to use this extension

```html
<body style="margin: 0; padding: 20px">
    <!-- Include a host div for the inking surface -->
    <div id="inkingHost" style="width: 800px; height: 800px; border: 1px solid black"></div>
</body>
```

```javascript
import { LiveShareHost } from "@microsoft/teams-js";
import { LiveShareClient } from "@microsoft/live-share";
import { LiveCanvas, InkingManager, InkingTool } from "@microsoft/live-share-canvas";

// Setup the Fluid container
const host = LiveShareHost.create();
const client = new LiveShareClient(host);
const containerSchema = {
    initialObjects: {
        // Include a LiveCanvas in your container schema
        liveCanvas: LiveCancas,
        ...
    }
};

const { container } = await client.joinContainer(containerSchema);

const inkingHost = document.getElementById("inkingHost");

// Create an InkingManager instance
const inkingManager = new InkingManager(inkingHost);

// Initialize the LiveCanvas, which will synchronize the events and
// drawing generated by the InkingManager passed as a parameter
const liveCanvas = container.initialObjects.liveCanvas as LiveCanvas;
await liveCanvas.initialize(inkingManager);

// Activate the InkingManager so it starts handling pointer input
inkingManager.activate();

// You can then select tools and setup brushes via the InkingManager instance
document.getElementById("btnPen").onclick = () => {
    inkingManager.tool = InkingTool.Pen;
}

document.getElementById("btnLaserPointer").onclick = () => {
    inkingManager.tool = InkingTool.LaserPointer;
}

document.getElementById("btnPenBrushBlue").onclick = () => {
    inkingManager.penBrush.color = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1};
}

// Other tools and brush settings are available, please refer to the documentation at https://aka.ms/livesharecanvas
```

## Package Compatibility

The Live Share SDK contains dependencies for [@microsoft/teams-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js) and [fluid-framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluid-framework) packages among others. Both of these packages are sensitive to the package version your app and libraries use. You will likely run into issues if the package version your app uses doesn't match the version other libraries you depend on use.

**It is critical that your app uses the package dependencies listed in the table below.** Lookup the version of the `@microsoft/live-share` you're using and set any other dependencies in your `package.json` file to match:

| @microsoft/live-share | @microsoft/teams-js  | fluid-framework | @microsoft/live-share-\*   | @fluidframework/azure-client | @microsoft/TeamsFx              | @microsoft/TeamsFx-react        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ^1.0.0                  | ^2.11.0             | ^1.2.3          | ^1.0.0                      | ^1.0.0                       | ^2.5.0                        | ^2.5.0                          |
