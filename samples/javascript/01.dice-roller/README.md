# Dice Roller - Live Share sample

This repository contains a simple app that enables all connected clients to roll a dice and view the result. For a
walkthrough of this example and how it works, check out the [tutorial documentation](https://aka.ms/fluid/tutorial).

## Requirements

Node 12.17+

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, install dependencies and start the application

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing the app in Teams

### Create a ngrok tunnel to allow Teams to reach your tab app

1. [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Launch ngrok with port 8080.
   `ngrok http 8080 --host-header=localhost`

### Create the app package to sideload into Teams

1. Open `.\manifest\manifest.json` and update values in it, including your [Application ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#id.
2. You must replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with the https path to your ngrok tunnel.
3. It is recommended that you also update the following fields.
    - Set `developer.name` to your name.
    - Update `developer.websiteUrl` with your website.
    - Update `developer.privacyUrl` with your privacy policy.
    - Update `developer.termsOfUseUrl` with your terms of use.
4. Create a zip file with the contents of `.\manifest` directory so that manifest.json, color.png, and outline.png are in the root directory of the zip file.
    - On Windows or Mac, select all files in `.\manifest` directory and compress them.
    - Give your zip file a descriptive name, e.g. `DiceRollerLiveShare`.

### Test it out

1. Schedule a meeting for testing from calendar in Teams.
2. Join the meeting.
3. In the meeting window, tap on **+ Apps** and tap on **Manage apps** in the flyout that opens.
4. In the **Manage apps** pane, tap on **Upload a custom app**.
    - _Don't see the option to **Upload a custom app?!** Follow [instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings) to enable custom-apps in your tenant._
5. Select the zip file you created earlier and upload it.
6. In the dialog that shows up, tap **Add** to add your sample app into the meeting.
7. Now, back in the meeting window, tap **+ Apps** again and type the name of your app in the _Find an app_ textbox.
8. Select the app to activate it in the meeting.
9. In the configuration dialog, just tap **Save** to add your app into the meeting.
10. In the side panel, tap the share icon to put your app on the main stage in the meeting.
