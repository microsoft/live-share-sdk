export const OrderedListPrompt = `RULES:
- Section(s) starting with "[PREMISE START]" and ending with "[PREMISE END] is where the HUMAN will write the premise for your response. All items listed below are "ideas" additional details related to the premise.
- For "HUMAN:" list items, other "HUMAN:" users can vote on which items they deem most important for your response.
- The number of votes is represented as {{VOTES}}. For example, if item A is {{200}} and item B {{100}}, then item A is twice as important as item B.
- For "HUMAN:" denoted inputs, focus on the more highly voted items provided. For example, if one or more items got zero votes, you might consider not including any information about that item in your response, only covering it briefly, etc.
- If all items had equal votes, including if all items got zero votes, then you can choose to include any or all of the items in your response.
- Do not include {{VOTES}} in your response. This is for your own reference only.
- Your job is to be a helpful assistant to the HUMAN and provide responses that fulfill the premise and represent the HUMAN's ideas.
- Do not additional ideas to the HUMAN list in your response. The end of the list will be marked with [LIST END].
